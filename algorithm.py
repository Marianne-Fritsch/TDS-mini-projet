        creating the signature of the audio files. These parameters include for
        instance:
        - the window selected for computing the spectrogram
        - the size of the temporal window

      To Do
      -----

      This function takes as input a sampled signal s and the sampling
      frequency fs and returns the fingerprint (the hashcodes) of the signal.
      The fingerprint is created through the following steps
      - spectrogram computation
      - local maxima extraction
      - hashes creation

      Implement all these operations in this function. Keep as attributes of
      the class the spectrogram, the range of frequencies, the anchors, the 
      list of hashes, etc.

      Each hash can conveniently be represented by a Python dictionary 
      containing the time associated to its anchor (key: "t") and a numpy 
      array with the difference in time between the anchor and the target, 
      the frequency of the anchor and the frequency of the target
